Minetest mod: HUD bar for armor [hbarmor]
=========================================
Version: 0.1.0

License of source code: WTFPL
-----------------------------
By Wuzzy,

forked from the mod “Better HUD (and hunger)” [hud]
by BlockMen (2013-2014).



Using the mod:
--------------
This mod adds a simple HUD bar which displays the current
damage of the player's armor (from the 3D Armor mod) as a percentage,
this number is of course rounded.
100% means the armor is in perfect shape, 0% means the armor
is almost destroyed or non-existant.
Note that to reach 100%, the player must wear at least 4 different
pieces of armor in perfect shape.
The armor bar also does not tell anything about the armor's strength,
only how worn out it already is.

By default, the armor bar is hidden if the player wears no armor.


Dependencies:
- HUD bars [hudbars], major version 1
- 3D Armor [3d_armor] (tested with 0.4.3)
